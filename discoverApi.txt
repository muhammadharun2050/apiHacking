    {If the API is for select customers or internal use, you’ll have to rely 
    on other clues: naming conventions, HTTP response header information 
    such as Content-Type: application/json, HTTP responses containing JSON/
    XML, and information about the JavaScript source files that power the 
    application.}

#OWASP Amass is a command line tool that can 
map a target’s external network by collecting OSINT from over 55 different sources. Command below

            amass enum -passive -d twitter.com |grep api   //for api findout
            amass intel -addr <target IP addresses>  //itel command use find ssl certificate
            amass intel -d <target domain> –whois  //find domain reserve lookup
            amass enum -passive -d <target domain>
            amass enum -acative -d <target domain>
            amass enum -active -brute -w /usr/share/wordlists/API_superlist -d <target domain> -dir (directory)
GitHub for OSINT could reveal your target’s API capabilities, documentation, and secrets, such as admin-level API keys, passwords, and tokens, 
which could be useful during an attack.

#see source code on github ypur terget . try find admin naame, api key, README.md File etc.
## Try searching for terms using the common API path terms, like “api,” “v1,” “v2,” “swagger,” “rest,” and “dev.”
